Based on the comprehensive analysis provided, the current outlook for AutoZone (AZO) presents a skewed risk/reward dynamic that favors reducing exposure rather than adding or maintaining a full position. Key factors influencing this decision include:

**1. Fundamental Risks:**  
- Inventory per store is rising while sales growth is flattening, raising concerns about possible overstock and margin pressure.
- Operating expenses are growing faster than revenue, with no guarantee near-term investments will translate into quick operational leverage.
- A historically high P/E above 25 leaves little margin for error, increasing downside sensitivity to any negative surprises.

**2. Technical Red Flags:**  
- Price action hovering near or below critical moving averages on weak volume typically precedes corrections in similar setups.
- Loss of momentum and institutional selling are additional negative technical signals.

**3. Valuation and Sentiment:**  
- Market consensus already assumes perfection; this leaves the stock vulnerable to reratings on any operational miss.
- Institutional investorsâ€™ reduction of positions historically precedes more pronounced selloffs.

**4. Lessons Applied:**  
In the past, hesitation to reduce positions in late-cycle leaders with deteriorating risk/reward has resulted in missed opportunities to lock in gains and redeploy capital more effectively. This time, preemptively protecting profits and reducing downside exposure is the prudent approach.

**Strategic Action:**  
- Begin reducing the AZO position by at least 25% now.
- Have a plan in place to continue selling additional tranches if key technical support levels fail.
- Consider redeployment of capital into names with better technical and valuation profiles.
- Maintain flexibility to potentially re-enter AZO on a market pullback or renewed margin/sales strength.

**Firm Decision:**  
Given the convergence of macro/industry-specific risks, stretched valuation, technical weakness, and shifting institutional sentiment, I recommend selling a meaningful portion of your AutoZone position at this time to protect capital and preserve gains.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
