Here’s my read-through and final call.

Bull case in a nutshell  
Axon keeps firing on all cylinders: Q1 revenue up 31% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA +43%, software & services ARR up about 39%, retention north of 95%. They’ve built a genuinely sticky law-enforcement ecosystem—bodycams, cloud evidence management, AI analytics—and they’re plowing $1.75 billion of fresh capital into AI tools and international expansion. The long-term secular tailwinds (digitizing police forces, public-safety SaaS, AI-driven workflows) remain intact. Technically the shares have just digested a run, and many see any pullback as a buying opportunity.

Bear case in a nutshell  
All that growth is baked into today’s premium valuation. With the stock trading in line with $800-plus targets, upside is slim, downside risk material: technical momentum is rolling over, volatility is high, macro headwinds could delay budgets, and rising leverage plus looming AI/privacy regulations add layers of execution risk. History shows that even “best-in-class” tech names can retrace 30–50% when growth normalizes or multiple contraction sets in.

My recommendation: Sell  
I lean with the bear. The reward-to-risk isn’t compelling at current levels. You’d be buying at essentially no margin of safety while paying for perfection. A material pullback—driven by any minor miss, regulatory headline or macro wobble—is far more likely than a re-run from here. That makes this a sell (or at minimum a full exit of any meaningful long position).

Rationale  
1. Valuation: Trading toward the high end of analyst targets with only single-digit upside. 2. Technicals & momentum: Indicators that accompanied prior peaks are flashing warning signs now, not buy signals. 3. Execution risks: International roll-outs often sap margins and stretch cash flow, and the new debt load magnifies any slowdown. 4. Regulatory uncertainty: Surveillance-adjacent AI businesses are in regulators’ crosshairs globally; compliance costs can clip returns. 5. Macro: Municipal budgets remain under pressure as inflation stays sticky and Fed cuts drift out.

Strategic actions  
1. Trim or close your Axon position now—lock in gains and sidestep the risk of a deeper drawdown. 2. Redeploy proceeds into areas with more attractive risk-reward—either cash and short-term bonds while waiting for a pullback, or select names with stronger near-term catalysts and lower leverage. 3. Set a re-entry framework: only consider buying back if Axon revisits key support around the 50-day moving average with declining volatility, or if it confirms a durable breakout above $800 on volume and positive guidance. 4. Use stop-losses or options hedges on any residual exposure to protect against sudden shifts. 5. Document any lessons learned—most importantly, never pay full price for future perfection and always demand a margin of safety in high-growth names.

That’s the call. We’re selling, waiting for a better setup, and will revisit once either fundamentals truly re-accelerate or the technical picture resets in our favor.
