After reviewing the comprehensive investment plan for ABT, I agree with the structured and risk-aware buy approach outlined in your analysis. Here’s my evaluation:

**Key Positives**  
- Abbott’s robust cash flow, reasonable valuation, and strong global growth drivers, especially with the FreeStyle Libre expansion, place it ahead of more cyclical or narrowly-focused healthcare plays.
- The stock's proximity to technical support (200-day moving average) has historically marked favorable entry points, especially when fundamentals remain intact.
- Macro headwinds—particularly rates and sector rotation—are real, but the measured, staggered entry and hedged approach mitigates risk if broader markets turn more defensive.

**Risk Mitigation**  
- By layering entries starting around $131–132 with further adds if downside continues, you avoid chasing short-term rallies and provide room to accumulate at lower-risk levels.
- The hard stop at $121 ensures losses are limited if support fails and the bull thesis is invalidated.
- Hedging 15–20% of the position with puts adds another layer of protection in a volatile macro environment.

**Past Mistakes Integrated**
- I recognize that in similar scenarios, failing to respect technical or macro warning signs led to suboptimal outcomes. This plan specifically counters that by not rushing in “all at once” and by adjusting size and hedging as the market dictates.

**Firm Recommendation**  
The balance of solid fundamentals with a clear, tactical entry strategy makes ABBT a buy at current levels, as part of a phased accumulation with strict stops and optional put hedges.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
