Based on your comprehensive proposal and analysis, I concur with the bearish outlook for ALB at this stage. Here’s a summary of my assessment and final recommendation:

**Market Analysis:**
- Despite technical signals of a possible bottom and past mistakes where early squeezes looked tempting, structural oversupply in the lithium market remains a dominant headwind.  
- Demand fundamentals are softer than anticipated, with EV adoption not accelerating fast enough to offset global supply—particularly from cost-advantaged producers.  
- The longer-term downtrend, institutional rotation out, and accumulating sell-side downgrades suggest that even if there’s a near-term bounce, the risk/reward profile is still unfavorable.  
- Dividend sustainability is not guaranteed when pricing pressure persists, and previous cycles demonstrate that “stalwart” payouts can succumb under prolonged margin compression.

**Risk Management:**
- Trimming or exiting positions now avoids capital erosion and the risk of falling into a value trap.  
- Hedging through out-of-the-money puts is prudent, should a rapid downside extension materialize.  
- Rotating funds into less cyclical, adjacent sectors (e.g., storage, alternative battery minerals) keeps exposure aligned with energy transition trends without being hostage to the current lithium supply/demand imbalance.

**Lessons from Past Decisions:**  
I’ve learned that giving too much weight to technical squeezes and chasing possible recoveries during a structural oversupply phase leaves investors exposed to further drawdowns. The prudent action is to wait for a clear improvement in fundamentals—such as contract lithium price recovery or a demonstrable supply response—before re-engaging.

**Final Recommendation:**  
Protect capital now, and wait for fundamental, not just technical, confirmation before considering re-entry. Stay nimble and keep capital ready for a better-timed opportunity.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
