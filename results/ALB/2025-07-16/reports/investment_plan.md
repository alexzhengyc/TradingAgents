Here’s how I see it after weighing both cases:

Key Bull Points  
• Albemarle has generated strong free cash flow (Q1 ’25 OF 545 million with 73 percent conversion) thanks to disciplined CapEx cuts and earlier capacity build-outs.  
• Their scale, long-term offtakes with top automakers and ESG credentials give them a durable position in the lithium supply chain—even in a down cycle.  
• Technical indicators (MACD crossover, RSI recovery, volume on up-moves) suggest the stock may be forming a cyclical bottom, and high short interest can fuel a squeeze.  
• A 126-quarter dividend streak underpins a psychological floor for many income-focused holders.

Key Bear Points  
• The current lithium oversupply looks more structural than cyclical, driven by low-cost, state-subsidized entrants in China and elsewhere—this could keep prices depressed into 2027 or beyond.  
• EV growth is slower than hoped (especially in China/EU), inventories are piling up, and government policies (tariffs, friend-shoring) add fresh headwinds to Albemarle’s margins.  
• On the charts the longer-term trend is still down (death cross on 50/200 SMAs), volume patterns point to distribution by institutions, and dividend sustainability is in question if prices don’t rebound quickly.  
• Sell-side downgrades are piling up, and net institutional ownership is falling—smart money seems cautious, not just bearish for timing reasons.

My Call: Sell  
I’m siding with the bear view. The bull case leans heavily on a cyclical rebound scenario that—given today’s evidence—may be overly optimistic about timing. When a structural glut meets slower EV adoption and growing policy risks, it’s premature to assume “the tape” has bottomed. Dividend track records are impressive, but history shows even the most stalwart payouts can be cut once cash flows get pinched further. Technical bounces can happen, but they often trap momentum-chasing bulls before the real upcycle begins.

Here’s our plan:

1. Exit or Trim Equity Exposure: If you hold ALB, reduce positions now around current levels. Don’t wait for a false break above the 200‐day moving average.  
2. Hedge Any Remaining Exposure: Consider buying out-of-the-money put options (e.g. Dec ’25 strikes 65–70) to protect against further downside in case the oversupply persists.  
3. Redeploy Capital More Defensively: Rotate into battery-adjacent, less cyclical names (e.g. established utility-scale storage players, renewable‐adjacent mining firms with tighter supply markets like cobalt or nickel).  
4. Monitor Key Triggers Before Re-Entry:  
   – A sustained recovery in contract lithium prices (back above $25k/tonne)  
   – Clear evidence of Chinese/Asian supply cutbacks or project delays  
   – A confirmed breakout above $79–80 on strong volume alongside better fundamental guidance  
5. Keep Cash Ready: If those triggers emerge in late 2026–early 2027, we can redeploy into ALB at better risk/reward.

Rationale & Lessons Learned  
In past cycles I was too quick to chase technical squeezes and under‐estimated how long structural oversupply can last when low-cost producers flood the market. This time, with policy uncertain and competitors able to withstand lower prices, downside risks still outweigh the short‐squeeze potential. By selling now and hedging, we protect capital and position ourselves to buy later only once fundamentals and sentiment align more convincingly.
