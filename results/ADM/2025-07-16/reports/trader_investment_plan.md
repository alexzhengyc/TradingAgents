Based on your comprehensive analysis and investment plan for ADM, I concur with the proposed strategy for several key reasons:

1. **Valuation Opportunity**: The forward P/E of 12.9 is notably below the historical and spot averages, indicating the market's pessimism may be overdone, especially as input costs stabilize and an earnings rebound appears likely.

2. **Operational Strengths**: ADM’s scale, global reach, and diversification across multiple business lines (feed, food, biofuels, specialty ingredients) provide significant resilience and flexibility—key advantages in volatile markets.

3. **Technical Confirmation**: The presence of a golden cross, supportive price action at the 50-day moving average ($52–53), and positive MACD signal a compelling technical entry point. These patterns historically attract institutional flows.

4. **Income and Downside Protection**: The 3.8% dividend yield and low leverage (D/E 0.34) add both income stability and balance sheet safety, which are critical if macro risks re-emerge.

**Risk Controls & Past Lessons**:  
Your reflection on avoiding early entry and capping position size is prudent. By scaling in at support, capping the initial exposure (2–3% of equity), and setting a stop near $51, you are mitigating the risks of headline shocks and technical breakdowns. Further, you wisely plan to add only on confirmed positive catalysts (earnings, litigation update).

**Conclusion**:  
ADM offers an asymmetric risk/reward profile at current levels with an attractive entry point, strong fundamental underpinnings, and a clear plan for risk management. Given these factors, the disciplined buy strategy outlined—initiating at $52–53 with potential to add on positive news—makes strategic sense.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
