### ACN Technical Analysis Report (as of 2025-07-15 – market data)

#### 1. Trend Analysis (Moving Averages)
- **50-day SMA:** 307.87 (as of 2025-07-15), trending downward from April’s range above 330, reflecting medium-term loss of bullish momentum.
- **200-day SMA:** 335.38, solidly above current prices. A significant “death cross” (50-sma below 200-sma) signals longer-term bearish regime, highlighting weakness since mid-Q2.
- **10-day EMA:** 289.68, indicating accelerated recent downside. It reacted quickly as the decline gathered pace since July, confirming strong short-term selling pressure.

#### 2. Momentum and Divergence (MACD, MACD Histogram, RSI)
- **MACD:** -6.95, sliding steadily negative since late June. This deepening bearish value reflects progressively stronger downward momentum and confirms that rallies are being aggressively sold.
- **MACD Histogram:** -2.30, showing growing bearish acceleration. The histogram moved decisively below zero earlier this month, warning that any countertrend bounces are likely to be short-lived unless the histogram begins to flatten and reverse.
- **RSI:** 29.72 — now entering classical oversold territory (sub-30). This marks the lowest reading of the past 30 days, underscoring near-term exhaustion in the selloff. Persistent sub-35 RSI can indicate “momentum holes” in bear runs, but also elevates risk of a technical bounce if sentiment quickly flips.

#### 3. Volatility and Risk
- **ATR (Average True Range):** 6.74, elevated versus prior weeks. This marks a notable expansion in volatility, confirming the highly reactive/uncertain market phase. Risk management is critical; wide daily swings mean both stops and targets should be adjusted accordingly.

#### 4. Volume Behavior (VWMA)
- **VWMA:** 292.96, only slightly above current spot prices. This tells us that moves lower have been accompanied by rising relative volume, confirming commitment behind sellers and affirming the importance of the recent bearish breakdown.

## TRENDS & INSIGHTS

1. **Downtrend Acceleration**
   - Both the **50-sma and 10-ema are declining**; the 10-ema is well below both the 50-sma and spot price for multiple sessions, underscoring downside momentum. The “death cross” with the 200-sma deepens the longer-term caution.

2. **Bearish Momentum Confirmed Across Systems**
   - **MACD** and **MACD histogram** are both markedly negative, with no meaningful bullish divergence — further evidence that bearish forces remain dominant.
   - **RSI** dipping below 30 signals the market could be nearing a temporary washout point, but in strong bear phases oversold readings can persist for weeks. Watch for bullish RSI divergence or “V” shaped price action as possible reversal clues.

3. **Heightened Volatility and Volume Amplify Risk**
   - **ATR** is elevated, emphasizing the need for prudent trade sizing and looser stops to avoid whipsaw. The **VWMA** shows selling pressure is real, not just illiquid down-drift — institutions are active.
   - High volatility and oversold RSI combine for a “compressed spring” scenario. Be alert to sharp, short-lived countertrend rallies, but do not treat them as sustainable without confirmation.

### Conclusion

- **Primary Trend:** Strongly bearish on all measured time frames.
- **Short-term Watch:** A tactical bounce is possible due to oversold RSI and stretched momentum. However, there is no evidence (yet) of a real momentum reversal; any upside is likely “countertrend” relief and could be sold into unless the MACD histogram flattens or RSI moves up above 35–40 with volume.
- **Risk Management:** High volatility demands disciplined positions and wider stops.
