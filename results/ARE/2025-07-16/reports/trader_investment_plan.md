Based on the thorough investment plan provided and consideration of both bullish and bearish arguments, the case for initiating a position in ARE is compelling:

- The asset quality is high, with ARE dominating difficult-to-replicate life-science hubs, and recent leasing activity underscores robust tenant demand.
- Valuation remains historically attractive at 0.6x book value and 6x EV/EBITDA, while the dividend yield is appealing around 7%, covered by FFO even as GAAP metrics appear weak.
- Institutional flows, insider buying, and volume-backed technical strength further support the idea that smart money has begun to accumulate the stock, potentially ahead of a multi-year recovery cycle.
- Although there are real risks—particularly leverage, CapEx, and macro headwinds—these are offset by the relatively defensive nature of ARE’s assets and resilient leasing activity.

Reflecting on past mistakes, it’s important not to delay entry indefinitely while waiting for a flawless quarter or perfect macro setup. The risk-reward tilts in favor of the patient investor willing to look beyond short-term volatility for long-term total return.

**Implementation—Following the Buy Strategy:**
- Initiate a 1% portfolio position now.
- Plan to add a further 1% on any dip into the $70–72 range.
- Use $75 as a reference for an average entry price.
- Actively monitor FFO coverage, occupancy metrics, and debt ratios per the outlined signals.
- Consider covered calls to boost yield in the near-term.

Given present evidence and sensible risk management, I recommend beginning to scale into ARE as described, adapting allocations as key performance and market indicators develop.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
