## Final Insights

ARE’s fundamentals reflect a well-capitalized REIT with an attractive yield and significant growth projects in the pipeline, but with meaningful short-term headwinds: recent profit declines, lean liquidity on a current basis, and over 6x book value flow translating to a healthy upside if industry conditions stabilize. Risk tolerance and investment horizon are critical considerations for any allocation decision.
