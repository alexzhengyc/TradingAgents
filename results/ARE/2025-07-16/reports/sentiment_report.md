It appears there was an error in retrieving company-specific news and sentiment for ARE (Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.) for the requested period. The information provided is generic about social media trends, not directly related to the company.

To provide actionable analysis as you requested, I need to include recent and specific news, sentiment, and social media conversations about ARE. At this time, the only information retrievable was generic trends and best practices in social media, which do not directly assist traders and investors in evaluating ARE’s recent company state as of July 2025.

I recommend retrying or utilizing another data source to fetch ARE-specific:
- Social media discussion (Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, etc.) sentiment and themes
- Recent press/news releases and headlines (earnings, guidance, management changes, REIT market news, etc.)
- Public sentiment indicators relevant to ARE and the broader real estate sector

If you have another way to access this info, please provide or authorize the retrieval so I can deliver the detailed analysis and required markdown table as specified. Let me know if you’d like me to try fetching the data again or proceed differently.
