Here’s how I see it after weighing both sides: you should get out of Wells Fargo now. Let me walk you through why the bear case outweighs the bull’s optimism, and how to execute on a Sell recommendation.

Summary of the Bull’s Case  
• Asset-cap removal is a once-in-a-decade catalyst, freeing up $1.95 trillion of balance-sheet capacity for loans, deposits, cards and tech finance.  
• Wells Fargo still trades below big-bank peers on P/E (13× forward) and price-to-book (1.5×), leaving room for multiple expansion.  
• Management is accelerating investments in fee businesses (wealth, advisory, healthcare lending) and digital upgrades, pointing to a longer-term inflection once those engines fire.  
• Technicals show a bullish alignment of major moving averages, and the 6 percent Q2 sell-off has repeatedly acted as a floor.

Summary of the Bear’s Case  
• Flat NII guidance the very quarter the cap was lifted signals growth is neither instant nor frictionless. Execution risk is high as Wells plays catch-up on tech and compliance.  
• Macro clouds are gathering—trade-war tariffs, Fed uncertainty, slowing GDP—and all banks will struggle. Why pay up for WFC when peers face the same headwinds but have already made their digital and fee-income pivots?  
• Valuation is already at or above peers on a full P/E, while P/FCF sits near 60×—extreme for a bank with under-realized cash flows. The yield has actually compressed to just over 2 percent, a warning sign.  
• Technically, the stock is overbought (RSI north of 70) and stuck under resistance. That’s a classic setup for a mean-reversion pullback, especially if the rest of the sector stumbles.

I conclude that the bear side has a stronger immediate case. The cap removal story is real—but it’s a multi-year project, not a light switch. In the meantime, you’re exposed to flat revenues, rising costs, macro fallout and a stock that’s already priced for perfection.

Your Plan of Attack

1. Recommendation: Sell Wells Fargo, trimming or closing your position into current strength.  
2. Rationale: You’re paying up for potential that may only show up in late 2024 or 2025, while near-term guidance, macro risks, execution hurdles and a fully valued multiple keep the risk/reward skewed to the downside.  
3. Strategic Actions:  
   – Initiate an orderly exit over the next two weeks; set a sliding scale of limit orders from today’s level down to key technical supports around $45 and then $42 to lock in gains or cut losses.  
   – Redirect proceeds into banks with cleaner tech track records and cheaper entry points—think large-caps like Bank of America (trading below 10× P/E with proven digital traction) or smaller regionals with strong loan pipelines that are trading at steeper discounts.  
   – If you want exposure to the sector’s upside, consider a broad bank ETF that diversifies execution risk across multiple franchises rather than concentrated on Wells Fargo’s catch-up hurdle.  
   – Keep a watch list on WFC near $38–40 and for concrete execution evidence—sustained NII growth, digital KPIs and operating metrics in line with peers—before even thinking about re-entry.  

I’ve been burned before by chasing post-regulatory “golden moment” stories at big banks that never quite materialized until years later—and only after the stock had already priced in half the upside. This time, the risks outweigh the reward. Sell now, redeploy into better-positioned names, and revisit Wells only after it proves it can execute on the asset-cap promise in a tougher macro.
