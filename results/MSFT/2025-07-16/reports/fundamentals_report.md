**In summary, Microsoft remains in strong financial shape and is entrenched as a leading player in critical tech sectors like AI and cloud. The primary watchpoints are its premium valuation and supply-side constraints on AI, which could slow growth in the near term. Otherwise, the company’s robust cash flow, high margins, and return on equity make it a foundational holding for many portfolios.**
