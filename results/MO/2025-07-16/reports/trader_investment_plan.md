After thoroughly considering your detailed investment plan alongside my own market analysis, I agree with your assessment of Altria (MO). The core issues are:

1. **Secular Decline**: The cigarette market faces irreversible volume shrinkage, heightened by unregulated competitors and disruptions in the “smoke-free” space where Altria lacks competitive foothold.
2. **Regulatory Risks**: Recent and pending flavor bans and youth-protection policies not only tighten margins but also reduce the legal market share, while illicit competition accelerates.
3. **Dividend Trap & Technical Weakness**: Technicals are flashing strong warning signals—failure to hold the 50-day moving average, bearish momentum, and increasing institutional selling. The high dividend yield no longer justifies holding, as true risk lies in a potential dividend cut or capital depreciation, an outcome already partially reflected in the discounted PE.
4. **Management Caution**: Leadership’s moderate outlook on growth and alternatives underscores a lack of near-term transformation drivers. Their guidance suggests no rapid turnaround.

**Lessons Applied**: In similar circumstances—especially in income-focused, regulated industries—I’ve underestimated the impact of regulatory headwinds and overvalued the protective effects of yield. This time, given the persistent negative sector drift and sharper macro/regulatory risks, I won’t rely on “safe yield” as a shield.

**Strategic Actions**:
- Exit at least 30–40% of MO holdings immediately.
- Set a stop-loss on the remainder to protect against steep declines.
- Seek opportunities in fundamentally stronger, secular-growth names or safer income assets.
- Only consider MO for tactical, short-term rebounds if indicators show extreme oversold conditions.

**Firm Decision**: The confluence of long-term decline, regulatory overhang, competitive disadvantage, and weak technicals leads to a clear course of action.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
