Let’s boil down what each side is arguing, then I’ll tell you where I come down—and how I’d act on it.

Bull’s strongest points  
• Fundamentals remain intact. Adobe still generates nearly $10 billion in free cash flow, carries 89 percent gross margins, and has one of the highest ROEs in software. Its recurring-revenue model and multi-cloud ecosystem give it real pricing power and stickiness.  
• Growth catalysts are in place. Management sees mid-teens EPS growth next year on $23.3–23.6 billion of sales. AI features like Firefly and Acrobat AI aren’t mere gimmicks—they’re embedded into workflows and should support upsell/cross-sell. Digital-commerce trends still run in Adobe’s favor.  
• Valuation reset creates opportunity. At a forward P/E near 17 and PEG just above 1, Adobe trades well below its historical norms and many lower-growth peers. Past deep technical sell-offs have often marked long-term entry points for this franchise.

Bear’s strongest points  
• Technical and sentiment breakdown is severe. All major moving averages and momentum indicators are trending down on heavy volume—this isn’t a mild pullback, it’s a conviction move lower.  
• Liquidity is borderline. Current and quick ratios under 1.0, rising debt, and flat-to-soft revenue guidance signal a company that has less cushion if cost pressures or macro headwinds intensify.  
• Competition and AI spend pose risks. Canva and Figma are chipping away at Adobe’s turf, subscription fatigue is real, and AI investments are heavy today but still too early to show material revenue payoffs. Margins could compress before they expand.

My call  
I side with the bull—this is a Buy opportunity. Adobe’s core business remains best-in-class, its valuation looks compelling, and the long-term digital transformation tailwinds haven’t gone away. The bear case is right that the chart is ugly and competition is rising, which means you need to respect risk, but the downside is increasingly priced in for a company with fortress-like cash flow.

Why buy now?  
1) You’re collecting a world-class SaaS cash machine at trough earnings multiples. Even if growth stalls briefly, free cash flow will support buybacks or dividend initiation.  
2) AI isn’t a hope-trade here—it’s already a part of the product suite, helping Adobe defend its moat. Once revenue starts reflecting those investments, multiple expansion should follow.  
3) History shows that after capitulation—especially in truly high-quality names—long-term holders are most rewarded. We’ve seen this pattern in Adobe before, and the business today is arguably stronger than in prior cycles.

Investment plan and next steps  
1) Position sizing and entry. Start with a 3 percent weighting of your total equity portfolio. Use limit orders to stagger buys around 5 percent and 10 percent below today’s price in case the sell-off continues.  
2) Risk control. Place a stop-loss roughly 12 percent below your average entry price to prevent a small tactical drawdown from turning into a large loss.  
3) Monitor catalysts. Watch for signs of technical stabilization—bullish reversal candlesticks, volume drying up on down days, or a rebound through the 50-day moving average. On the fundamental side, track quarterly revenue vs. guidance, AI-related upsell metrics, and any tightening of liquidity ratios.  
4) Re-evaluate at key milestones. If Adobe’s stock price recovers through $500 with confirming volume and EPS guidance stays on track, consider adding the remaining 4 percent to reach a 7 percent total allocation. If liquidity continues to erode or AI investments fail to translate into rising ARPU after two quarters, reassess with a willingness to trim back.  
5) Stay humble. Past mistakes teaching us that no company is untouchable, so keep an eye on both the bull and bear signals. But right now the fundamental runway and valuation argument are stronger than the technical breakdown is bearish.

Bottom line: Buy Adobe in tranches, respect your stop, and give the business time to re-earn investor confidence.
